# hello-world

This first Git project is dedicated to Daniel.

Product search for refurbished Mac, example: iPad2 - 64 GB.

To run the search every hour edit your crontab like so (works for Mac and Linux):
```bash
crontab -e
```
and add there the line `0 * * * *  python3 <path-to-file iPad-Search.py>`.
